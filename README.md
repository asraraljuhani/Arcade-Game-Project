# Arcade-Game-Project
This is my application of Arcade Game Project of FEND from Udacity.
# Getting Started
Download the project and open  **index.html** file using any web browser and you ready to play the game. 
# How To Play The Game 
You are the player and you could move right, left, up and down, you have to reach the sea (the blue first row) without touch the bugs.
If you touch the bugs will lose the game and start again.
# Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* [Sweet Modal](https://github.com/adeptoas/sweet-modal) library in JS ,  I use it for the alart of wining and losing on the game.
# Acknowledgments
